There has been much recent progress in natural language processing, and grammatical error correction (GEC) is no exception. We found that state-of-the-art GEC systems (T5 and GECToR) outperform humans by a wide margin on the CoNLL-2014 test set, a benchmark GEC test corpus, as measured by the standard F0.5 evaluation metric. However, a careful examination of their outputs reveals that there are still classes of errors that they fail to correct. This suggests that creating new test data that more accurately measure the true performance of GEC systems constitutes important future work.
